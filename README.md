##### Project Description

## Background of the problem

The project was given to me by my coaches at BeCode, where i was following a web developement training. The main purpose of the exercice was to check if i had acquired basic competencies regarding the HTML 5 and CSS 3 language. 

In this project, i wanted to consolidate the knowledge i've acquired through the first two weeks of the training program. So it was not just for fun since this project will be evaluated. 

After, i walso wanted to learn how to structure the page with CSS grid and flex properties. 

## Technical design

I created my own Tim Berners Lee page to practice and structure my learning path. I had all the tools i needed to do it, ie , an IDE : Bracketts, a git hub account, git, gish bash and an internet connection of course. However, i would be curious to do the project again with some SASS and then some javascript. 

When i was building the project, i felt frustrated because that was not as easy as i would have imagined : When i was i front of an empty IDE, i was not that comfortable. However i considered asking my colleagues for some help with the structure and so a good ideam came  out of this : make a physical structure with a pen on a blank paper and then use Grid or Flex to have the blocks you want on the page. After that, i was way easier to continue the developement of the project. 

I mainly encoutered positioning problem, i solved one with the "auto width" property, you can see it in one of my latest commit. I have left some issues : for instance : the page is not seperated in three parts and the social network's logo are not the ones asked in the task's description. Why ? Because i obviously lacked some competencies but this is good since it is the purpose of the exercice. My plan would be to, each end of the month, go back on all the projects made the last 30 days and see what can i improve with my new knowledges.
